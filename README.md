# flight_ticket

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest #Flutter project!
Introducing 'FlightTickets', a sleek, intuitive, and a delightful way you can book your flight ticket ðŸŽ« ðŸ¤ª.
FlightTickets provides a very realistic and interactive interface UI providing smooth and easy navigation across the app resulting to a delightful experience ðŸ˜Ž.
#Flutter
#Dart
#FlightTickets
While building FlightTickets, I implemented the following package:
a) Get package: I used this to get device screen size, which helps me to direct how the interface would be displayed across the width and the height of the phone device.

b) fluentui_system_icons: This package provides icons that was across in the bottom navigation bar and also across other sections in the app.

c) Gap package :
This helps me to constantly make proper spacing across the layout ( container, Columns and row widgets).

I used various widgets such as positioned, stack, listview, sized boxed, circle avatar, row, column, container widgets.
